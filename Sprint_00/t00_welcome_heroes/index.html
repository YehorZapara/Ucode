    <h2 id="id"> What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>Superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
        being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a
        fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
        police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is
        fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
        couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <p>Constantine</p>
    <p>John Constantine is an occult detective from Liverpool, England. His violent and anti-social attitude makes him a
        formidable anti-hero, and he's known for doing whatever it takes to get the job done.</p>
